\title{Compute fixed row sums / hypergeometric backbone probabilities}
\usage{
fixedrow(B)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{graph: An unweighted bipartite graph object of class matrix, sparse matrix, igraph, edgelist, or network object.
Any rows and columns of the associated bipartite matrix that contain only zeros are automatically removed before computations.}
}
\value{
backbone, a list(positive, negative, summary). Here
    `positive` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or above the observed value in the projection,
    `negative` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or below the observed value in the projection, and
    `summary` is a data frame summary of the inputted matrix and the model used including: class, model name, number of rows, number of columns, and running time.
}
\description{
`fixedrow` computes the probability of observing
    a higher or lower edge weight using the hypergeometric distribution.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return
    the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
}
\details{
Specifically, this function compares an edge's observed weight in the projection \eqn{B*t(B)} to the
    distribution of weights expected in a projection obtained from a random bipartite graph where
    the row vertex degrees are fixed but the column vertex degrees are allowed to vary.
