\usage{
sparsify(
  U,
  s,
  escore = "original",
  normalize,

  umst = FALSE,
  class = "original",
  narrative = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{An unweighted unipartite graph, as: (1) an adjacency matrix in the form of a matrix or sparse \code{\link{Matrix}}; (2) an edgelist in the form of a two-column dataframe; (3) an \code{\link{igraph}} object.}

\item{s}{numeric: Sparsification parameter}

\item{escore}{string: Method for scoring edges' importance}

\item{normalize}{string: Method for normalizing edge scores}

\item{filter}{string: Type of filter to apply}

\item{umst}{boolean: TRUE if the backbone should include the union of minimum spanning trees, to ensure connectivity}

\item{class}{string: the class of the returned backbone graph, one of c("original", "matrix", "Matrix", "igraph", "edgelist").
If "original", the backbone graph returned is of the same class as \code{U}.}

\item{narrative}{boolean: TRUE if suggested text & citations should be displayed.}
}
\value{
An unweighted, undirected, unipartite graph of class \code{class}.
}
\description{
A generic function to extract the backbone of an undirected, unipartite
network using a sparsification model described by a combination of an edge scoring metric, a
edge score normalization, and an edge score filter.
}
\details{
The \code{escore} parameter determines how an unweighted edge's importance is calculated.
Unless noted below, scores are symmetric and larger values represent more important edges.
There are 10 options for assigning an edge's score; when \verb{escore = }
\itemize{
\item \code{random}: a random number drawn from a uniform distribution
\item \code{betweenness}: edge betweenness
\item \code{triangles}: number of triangles that include the edge
\item \code{jaccard}: jaccard coefficient of the neighborhoods of an edge's endpoints, or alternatively, triangles normalized by the size of the union of the endpoints neighborhoods
\item \code{quadrangles}: number of quadrangles that include the edge
\item \verb{quadrilateral embeddedness}: geometric mean normalization of quadrangles
\item \code{degree}: degree of neighbor to which an edge is adjacent (asymmetric)
\item \code{meetmin}: triangles normalized by the smaller of the endpoints' neighborhoods' sizes
\item \code{geometric}: triangles normalized by the product of the endpoints' neighborhoods' sizes
\item \code{hypergeometric}: probability of the edge being included at least as many triangles if edges were random, given the size of the endpoints' neighborhoods (smaller is more important)
}

The \code{normalize} parameter determines whether edge scores are normalized.
There are three options; when \verb{normalize = }
\itemize{
\item \code{none}: no normalization is performed
\item \code{rank}: scores are normalized by neighborhood rank, such that the strongest edge in a node's neighborhood is ranked 1 (asymmetric)
\item \code{embeddedness}: scores are normalized using the maximum Jaccard coefficient of the top k-ranked neighbors of each endpoint, for all k
}

The \code{filter} parameter determines how edges are filtered based on their (normalized) edge scores.
There are three options; when \verb{filter = }
\itemize{
\item \code{threshold}: Edges with scores more important than \code{s} are retained in the backbone
\item \code{proportion}: Specifies the proportion of most important edges to retain in the backbone
\item \code{degree}: Retains each node's d^\code{s} most important edges, where d is the node's degree (requires that \code{normalize = "rank"})
}

Specific combinations of \code{escore}, \code{normalize}, \code{filter}, and \code{umst} correspond to specific sparsification models in the literature, and are available via the following wrapper functions:
\code{\link[=sparsify.with.skeleton]{sparsify.with.skeleton()}}, \code{\link[=sparsify.with.gspar]{sparsify.with.gspar()}}, \code{\link[=sparsify.with.lspar]{sparsify.with.lspar()}}, \code{\link[=sparsify.with.simmelian]{sparsify.with.simmelian()}}, \code{\link[=sparsify.with.jaccard]{sparsify.with.jaccard()}}, \code{\link[=sparsify.with.meetmin]{sparsify.with.meetmin()}}, \code{\link[=sparsify.with.geometric]{sparsify.with.geometric()}}, \code{\link[=sparsify.with.hypergeometric]{sparsify.with.hypergeometric()}}, \code{\link[=sparsify.with.localdegree]{sparsify.with.localdegree()}}, \code{\link[=sparsify.with.quadrilateral]{sparsify.with.quadrilateral()}}.
