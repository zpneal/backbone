\title{The stochastic degree sequence model (sdsm)}
\usage{
sdsm(B, trials = 1000, model = "polytope", progress = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{graph: Bipartite graph object of class matrix, sparse matrix, igraph, edgelist, or network object.}

\item{trials}{Integer: Number of random bipartite graphs generated. Default is 0.}

\item{model}{String: A method used to compute probabilities for generating random bipartite graphs.
Can be c("logit", "probit", "cauchit", "log", "cloglog", "lpm", "chi2", "curveball", "polytope").}

\item{progress}{Boolean: If \link[utils]{txtProgressBar} should be used to measure progress}
}
\value{
backbone, a list(positive, negative, dyad_values, summary). Here
    `positive` is a matrix of proportion of times each entry of the projected matrix B is above the corresponding entry in the generated projection,
    `negative` is a matrix of proportion of times each entry of the projected matrix B is below the corresponding entry in the generated projection,
    `dyad_values` is a list of edge weight for i,j in each generated projection, included if 'dyad' not NULL and 'trials > 0', and
     `summary` is a data frame summary of the inputted matrix and the model used including: model name, number of rows, skew of row sums, number of columns, skew of column sums, and running time.
}
\description{
`sdsm` computes the probability of edge weights being
    above or below the observed edge weights in a bipartite projection
    using the stochastic degree sequence model.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return
    the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
}
\details{
Specifically, the sdsm function compares an edge's observed weight in the projection \code{B*t(B)}
   to the distribution of weights expected in a projection obtained from a random bipartite network where
   both the row vertex degrees and column vertex degrees are approximately fixed.

If the 'model' parameter is one of c('logit', 'probit', 'cauchit', 'log', 'cloglog'),
    then this model is used as a 'link' function for a binary outcome model conditioned on the row degrees and column degrees,
    as described by \link[stats]{glm} and \link[stats]{family}.
    If the 'model' parameter is 'oldlogit', then a logit link function is used but the model is conditioned on the row degrees, column degrees, and their product.
    If 'model = lpm', a linear probability model is used. If 'model = chi2', a chi-squared model is used.

If 'trials'>0, and 'model' == 'curveball', probabilities are computed by using \link[backbone]{curveball} function `trials` times. The proportion of each cell being 1 is used as its probability.
    If 'model = polytope', the \link{polytope} function is used to find a matrix of probabilities that maximizes the entropy function, with same row and column sums.
