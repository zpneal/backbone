  B,

}
\arguments{
\item{B}{An unweighted bipartite graph, as: (1) an incidence matrix in the form of a matrix or sparse \code{\link{Matrix}}; (2) an edgelist in the form of a two-column dataframe; (3) an \code{\link{igraph}} object.}

\item{alpha}{real: significance level of hypothesis test(s)}

\item{trials}{numeric: the number of bipartite graphs generated to approximate the edge weight distribution. If NULL, the number of trials is selected based on \code{alpha} (see details)}

\item{signed}{boolean: TRUE for a signed backbone, FALSE for a binary backbone (see details)}

\item{mtc}{string: type of Multiple Test Correction to be applied; can be any method allowed by \code{\link{p.adjust}}.}

\item{class}{string: the class of the returned backbone graph, one of c("original", "matrix", "Matrix", "igraph", "edgelist").
If "original", the backbone graph returned is of the same class as \code{B}.}

\item{narrative}{boolean: TRUE if suggested text & citations should be displayed.}

\item{progress}{boolean: TRUE if the progress of Monte Carlo trials should be displayed.}

\item{...}{optional arguments}
}
\value{
If \code{alpha} != NULL: Binary or signed backbone graph of class \code{class}.

If \code{alpha} == NULL: An S3 backbone object containing (1) the weighted graph as a matrix, (2) upper-tail p-values as a
matrix, (3, if \code{signed = TRUE}) lower-tail p-values as a matrix, (4, if present) node attributes as a dataframe, and
(5) several properties of the original graph and backbone model, from which a backbone can subsequently be extracted
using \code{\link[=backbone.extract]{backbone.extract()}}.

\description{
\code{fdsm} extracts the backbone of a bipartite projection using the Fixed Degree Sequence Model.
}
\details{
The \code{fdsm} function compares an edge's observed weight in the projection \code{B*t(B)} to the distribution of weights
expected in a projection obtained from a random bipartite network where both the row vertex degrees and column
vertex degrees are \emph{exactly} fixed at their values in \code{B}. It uses the \code{\link[=fastball]{fastball()}} algorithm to generate random
bipartite matrices with give row and column vertex degrees.

When \code{signed = FALSE}, a one-tailed test (is the weight stronger) is performed for each edge with a non-zero weight. It
yields a backbone that perserves edges whose weights are significantly \emph{stronger} than expected in the chosen null
model. When \code{signed = TRUE}, a two-tailed test (is the weight stronger or weaker) is performed for each every pair of nodes.
It yields a backbone that contains positive edges for edges whose weights are significantly \emph{stronger}, and
negative edges for edges whose weights are significantly \emph{weaker}, than expected in the chosen null model.
\emph{NOTE: Before v2.0.0, all significance tests were two-tailed and zero-weight edges were evaluated.}

The p-values used to evaluate the statistical significance of each edge are computed using Monte Carlo methods. The number of
\code{trials} performed affects the precision of these p-values, and the confidence that a given p-value is less than the
desired \code{alpha} level. Because these p-values are proportions (i.e., the proportion of times an edge is weaker/stronger
in the projection of a random bipartite graphs), evaluating the statistical significance of an edge is equivalent to
comparing a proportion (the p-value) to a known proportion (alpha). When \code{trials = NULL}, the \code{power.prop.test} function
is used to estimate the required number of trials to make such a comparison with a \code{alpha} type-I error rate, (1-\code{alpha}) power,
and when the riskiest p-value being evaluated is at least 5\% smaller than \code{alpha}. When any \code{mtc} correction is applied,
for simplicity this estimation is based on a conservative Bonferroni correction.
