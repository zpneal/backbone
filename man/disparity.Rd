\usage{
disparity(
  W,
  alpha = 0.05,
  signed = FALSE,
  mtc = "none",
  class = "original",
  narrative = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A weighted unipartite graph, as: (1) an adjacency matrix in the form of a matrix or sparse \code{\link{Matrix}}; (2) an edgelist in the form of a three-column dataframe; (3) an \code{\link{igraph}} object.}

\item{alpha}{real: significance level of hypothesis test(s)}

\item{signed}{boolean: TRUE for a signed backbone, FALSE for a binary backbone (see details)}

\item{mtc}{string: type of Multiple Test Correction to be applied; can be any method allowed by \code{\link{p.adjust}}.}

\item{class}{string: the class of the returned backbone graph, one of c("original", "matrix", "Matrix", "igraph", "edgelist").
If "original", the backbone graph returned is of the same class as \code{W}.}

\item{narrative}{boolean: TRUE if suggested text & citations should be displayed.}
}
\value{
If \code{alpha} != NULL: Binary or signed backbone graph of class \code{class}.

If \code{alpha} == NULL: An S3 backbone object containing (1) the weighted graph as a matrix, (2) upper-tail p-values as a
matrix, (3, if \code{signed = TRUE}) lower-tail p-values as a matrix, (4, if present) node attributes as a dataframe, and
(5) several properties of the original graph and backbone model, from which a backbone can subsequently be extracted
using \code{\link[=backbone.extract]{backbone.extract()}}.
}
\description{
\code{disparity} extracts the backbone of a weighted network using the Disparity Filter.
}
\details{
The \code{disparity} function applies the disparity filter (Serrano et al., 2009), which compares an edge's weight to
its expected weight if a node's total degree was uniformly distributed across all its edges. The graph may be
directed or undirected, however the edge weights must be positive.

When \code{signed = FALSE}, a one-tailed test (is the weight stronger) is performed for each edge with a non-zero weight. It
yields a backbone that perserves edges whose weights are significantly \emph{stronger} than expected in the chosen null
model. When \code{signed = TRUE}, a two-tailed test (is the weight stronger or weaker) is performed for each every pair of nodes.
It yields a backbone that contains positive edges for edges whose weights are significantly \emph{stronger}, and
negative edges for edges whose weights are significantly \emph{weaker}, than expected in the chosen null model.

If \code{W} is an unweighted bipartite graph, then the disparity filter is applied to its weighted bipartite projection.
