#' Extracts a backbone network from a backbone object
#'
#' `backbone.extract` returns a binary or signed adjacency matrix
#'      containing the backbone that retains only the significant edges.
#'
#' @param bb.object backbone: backbone S3 class object.
#' @param signed Boolean: TRUE for a signed backbone, FALSE for a binary backbone (see details)
#' @param alpha Real: significance level of hypothesis test(s)
#' @param mtc string: type of Multiple Test Correction to be applied; can be any method allowed by \code{\link{p.adjust}}.
#' @param class string: the class of the returned backbone graph, one of c("matrix", "sparseMatrix", "igraph", "edgelist"), converted via \link{tomatrix}.
#' @param narrative boolean: TRUE if suggested text & citations should be displayed.
#' @return backbone graph: Binary or signed backbone graph of class given in parameter `class`.
#'
#' @details The "backbone" S3 class object is composed of (1) the weighted graph as a matrix, (2) upper-tail p-values as a
#'    matrix, (3, if `signed = TRUE`) lower-tail p-values as a matrix, (4, if present) node attributes as a dataframe, and
#'    (5) several properties of the original graph and backbone model
#'
#' When `signed = FALSE`, a one-tailed test (is the weight stronger) is performed for each edge with a non-zero weight. It
#'    yields a backbone that perserves edges whose weights are significantly *stronger* than expected in the chosen null
#'    model. When `signed = TRUE`, a two-tailed test (is the weight stronger or weaker) is performed for each every pair of nodes.
#'    It yields a backbone that contains positive edges for edges whose weights are significantly *stronger*, and
#'    negative edges for edges whose weights are significantly *weaker*, than expected in the chosen null model.
#'    *NOTE: Before v2.0.0, all significance tests were two-tailed and zero-weight edges were evaluated.*
